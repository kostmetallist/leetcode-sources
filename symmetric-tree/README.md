# Symmetric Tree

[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/description/)

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Examples

| Input | Expected Output |
| ----- | --------------- |
| `root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` | `true` |
| `root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` | `false` |
