# Add Two Numbers

[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a
single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
number `0` itself.

## Examples

| Input | Expected Output |
| ----- | --------------- |
| `l1 = [2, 4, 3]; l2 = [5, 6, 4]` | `[7, 0, 8]` |
| `l1 = [0]; l2 = [0]` | `[0]` |
| `l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]; l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]` | `[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]` |
