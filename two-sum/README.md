# Two Sum

[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the
two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not
use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.


`2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`; `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`;
`-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`.


## Examples

| Input | Expected Output |
| ----- | --------------- |
| `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]; target = 9` | `[0, 1]` |
| `nums = [3, 2, 4]; target = 6` | `[1, 2]` |
