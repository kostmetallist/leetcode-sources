# Trapping Rain Water

[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

## Description

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of
each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

- `n == height.length`
- `0 <= n <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`

## Examples

| Input | Expected Output |
| ----- | --------------- |
| `height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]` | `6` |
| `height = [4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]` | `9` |
