# Second Highest Salary

[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/)

## Description

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```
+----+--------+

+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

the second highest salary.
