# Binary Search

[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an
integer target, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target`
exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Examples

| Input | Expected Output |
| ----- | --------------- |
| `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9` | `4` |
| `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2` | `2` |
